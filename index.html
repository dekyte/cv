              <p class="card-text">Lance Cole (LC Painting) provided us with a detailed bid, a good forecast for when the work would occur and an excellent outcome. He has great communication skills and was available to answer questions throughout the job. He reviewed the scope of the work with us and made sure that we were prepared for his service. His prep work on the house was extensive. The workers were very tidy and professional. The job was done exactly to our specifications with an eye to detail. Lance uses premium paints and assists with color choices if needed. The bid on the job included paint and materials. The price was very reasonable considering the area that we live in (West San Jose) and the competition for reliable service. I would not hesitate to recommend him to others.</p>

              <h6>Mar 29, 2018</h6>
              <p class="card-text">I had Lance and his team paint the exterior of our house. His team did a great job, particularly in prep work. His team spent several more days doing prep work than the painters that worked on my neighbor's similar house. Lance showed me in advance where dry rot required new material before painting. He later found other areas where dry rot had occurred. He replaced boards as needed and used epoxy for some difficult repairs. I asked him to give me cost of the extra items at the end, which he did. The extra cost was very reasonable. I am very happy with the work that was done. I highly recommend Lance and his team for their quality of work.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Lance and crew painted interior and exterior of about 1000 square feet of house. We got a few bids; his was about in the middle but he had much better specific advice about tradeoffs and issues they might run into. In the end my confidence in Lance's estimate was high, and he seemed easy to work with and discuss any issues or decisions that always come up. The work was done exactly when he thought (at the time, contractors were booked 6-10 weeks out), and took exactly as long as he estimated. The work from start to finish was superb in every way: protecting, preparation, painting, finishing, and cleanup. Questions and issues were brought up right away and easily settled. We are in awe of the quality of the work. We've owned homes for almost 40 years and have never had this quality level of work, and are very glad we took Lance's bid. Absolutely no caveats, no issues; highly professional all the way, and outstanding results.</p>
